## 🧠 Usage

### ➕ Log a new mood

```bash
VibeMatrix add
```

You’ll be asked to select or type your current mood:

```
How are you feeling today?
😎 Happy
😂 Excited
😴 Tired
😭 Sad
🤯 Stressed
```

### 📊 View all mood stats

```bash
VibeMatrix stats
```

Example output:

```
Your Mood Summary:

😎 ▓▓▓▓▓▓ (5)
😂 ▓▓▓ (3)
😴 ▓ (1)

Total moods logged: 9
```

### 🗑️ Reset all logs

```bash
VibeMatrix reset
```

Deletes all stored data from your local `.mood-logs.json`.

---

## 🧩 How It Works

* Moods are saved in a small local JSON file (like `.mood-logs.json`) in your home directory.
* Each time you add a mood, it increments the count.
* When you view stats, a small ASCII/emoji bar chart is generated using simple characters or blocks (like ▓ or ░).

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Node not recognized in VS Code terminal

If `npm link` or `node` shows an error like:

```
The term 'node.exe' is not recognized...
```

Try these fixes:

1. Check Node in Command Prompt:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

   If it works there, the issue is with VS Code.

2. **Restart VS Code** completely.
   It may not have loaded your PATH variable yet.

3. **Add Node.js to your PATH** manually:

   * Open “Environment Variables”
   * Edit the `Path` under System variables
   * Add:

     ```
     C:\Program Files\nodejs\
     ```
   * Restart your system.

4. In VS Code, switch terminal to **Command Prompt**:

   * Click the arrow (˅) in terminal tab
   * Choose “Select Default Profile” → “Command Prompt”
   * Open new terminal.

```
😎 ▓▓▓▓▓▓ (5)
😂 ▓▓▓ (3)
😴 ▓ (1)

Keep smiling! 😎
